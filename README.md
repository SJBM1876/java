# java


- I will learn Java by following the below Learning Plan  starting on 04/11/2024.

- I will finish the Learning Plan linked above by 29/11/2024.

Learning Plan (draft)
Week 1: Java Fundamentals
#checkoutTheDocs: Read documentation on Java basics. Suggested resources:

Oracle Java Documentation
Baeldung Java Tutorials
Java tutorials on Udemy or Codecademy if you prefer guided lessons.
Getting Started with Java:

Day 1-2:
Understand the basics of Java: its uses, benefits, and popularity.
Install JDK and choose an IDE (IntelliJ IDEA). Configure your IDE to recognize the JDK.
Day 3: Write your first program, "Hello, World!"
Day 4-5:
Dive into basic syntax: variables, data types, operators, and control structures (if-else, loops).
Mini Project: Build a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game using Math.random(), Math.round(), and Scanner to take user input.

Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java
Object-Oriented Programming Concepts:

Day 1-2:
Research and read about OOP fundamentals: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
Watch tutorials on OOP basics.
Day 3-4:
Practice by creating classes with fields and methods.
Explore encapsulation using access modifiers (public, private, protected).
Day 5: Learn inheritance and polymorphism. Create subclasses, apply inheritance, and practice method overriding.
Mini Project:

Option 1: Scooter Application - Create a class to model scooters.
Option 2: Employee Records System - Set up an Employee class and subclasses (Manager, SalesPerson). Add methods for employee actions and a small menu to manage records.

Week 3: Advanced Java Concepts
Advanced Java Topics:

Day 1-2:
Study Exception Handling and learn how to handle runtime errors using try-catch.
Practice with different types of exceptions (checked and unchecked).
Day 3:
Study Generics to write type-safe code. Focus on creating type-safe collections with generics.
Day 4:
Dive into Collections Framework: Understand ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, and HashMap.
Day 5:
Explore Multithreading: Learn how to create and manage threads.
Mini Project:

Option 1: Chat Application - Set up a simple text-based application that allows message exchange. Use multithreading for simultaneous actions and generics to manage different data types in the chat.
Option 2: Multiplayer Game - Implement a simple multiplayer text-based game. Use threads to allow multiple players and collections to manage scores and player data.

Week 4: File I/O, Networking, and Java Best Practices
File I/O and Networking:

Day 1-2:
Learn to read from and write to files in Java. Understand InputStream and OutputStream for file handling.
Day 3:
Study Standard Input/Output (System.in and System.out) to interact with the console.
Day 4:
Introduction to Networking in Java, including basic client-server architecture using Sockets.
Java Best Practices:

Day 5:
Code Organization: Organize code with packages, adhere to naming conventions, and use design patterns.
Testing: Learn and practice JUnit for unit testing.
Debugging: Use your IDEâ€™s debugger and logging to troubleshoot errors.
Final Project:

Update an existing project (like the Chat App or Multiplayer Game) to:
Save/load data from files (e.g., chat history or player scores).
Follow code organization and style principles.
Add JUnit tests and debug any existing issues.
Post-Plan Projects and Next Steps
Challenge Yourself with Advanced Projects: Try a To-Do List App or Tic-Tac-Toe Game to practice further.
Participate in Coding Challenges: Platforms like HackerRank and LeetCode are great for reinforcing concepts.
Learn a Framework: After mastering Java, explore Spring or Hibernate for web and database applications.
